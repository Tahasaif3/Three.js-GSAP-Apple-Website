# Three.js and GSAP Exploration: Apple iPhone 15 Pro Website Clone

This project is a hands-on exploration of **Three.js** (for 3D rendering) and **GSAP** (GreenSock Animation Platform) through a partial recreation of Apple's iPhone 15 Pro website.  The goal was to practice and deepen my understanding of these powerful web technologies.

### 🎯 Key Features

*   **Smooth 3D Interactions:** Experience the iPhone 15 Pro in 3D with intuitive mouse-based controls.
*   **Dynamic Animations:** GSAP powers subtle and engaging animations that enhance the user experience.
*   **Color and Size Variations:** Explore different models with realistic color options and size scaling.
*   **Custom Carousel (GSAP):** A unique video carousel showcases the device's features with smooth scrolling.
*   **Responsive Design:** The website adapts to various screen sizes, ensuring a consistent experience.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack

*   **Core Libraries:**
    *   **Three.js:** 3D graphics
